## What is it about?
Particulate is built to streamline the stage effects production for Minecraft Music festivals. Used in festivals such as [Exofest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVIpt88bQcA), and Shimotsuki's New Horizons Festival (Day [1](https://youtu.be/A8uwsTKqaMY), [2](https://youtu.be/s08xHYcUWVA), and [3](https://youtu.be/EGhlkEpXmok)).
Particulate lets you use a web dashboard to control effects in-game.

## How does it work?
Particulate operates unidirectionally. It's split into four parts: Particulate Frontend/Dashboard, Particulate Bridge, Redis, and the Particulate Rendering plugin.

Using the dashboard, users connect to their own personally hosted Particulate Bridge. The Particulate Bridge forwards commands from the dashboard to Redis, which then distributes the command to all of the Paper servers running the Particulate Rendering plugin.

Particulate is built to provide support for as many paper servers as you need!

## No more DMX
Particulate is a clean and easy replacement for DMX controlled Minecraft show plugins.
Particulate is not meant to be a 1-to-1 replacement for DMX. By using Particulate, you are accepting a simpler design and ease of use, for the ability to highly customize your visuals.

## Simple Dashboard Integration
Build your own version of the Particulate dashboard, or use ours!
Particulate lets you import and export templates and connect to YOUR Particulate backend!

## Share your Particulate template with others
Particulate lets you export and import your dashboard setup. That way you can even share it with fellow FX Opperators!
